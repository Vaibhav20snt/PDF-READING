The project involves PDF Processing and Search, where text is extracted from PDFs, segmented into manageable chunks, and converted into vector embeddings using FAISS and Google Generative AI to enable efficient retrieval. Additionally, it includes a Conversational AI Interface, which leverages LangChain and Googleâ€™s Generative AI to create an interactive Streamlit application for natural language question-answering based on uploaded PDFs. The implementation relies on technologies such as ML, NLP, and LLMs.
